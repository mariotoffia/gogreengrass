# gogreengrass
Python wrapper to deploy go lambdas into green grass. It also encapsulates the python greengrass SDK so go code may invoke
the python SDK to do device shadow operations, secrets manager and publish data onto _MQTT_.

Install the command line tool by `go get -u github.com/mariotoffia/gogreengrass`
